# Shortest-Path-Finder-IIT-Kharagpur-Campus
This C++ code implements a real time use case of Floyd-Warshall algorithm to  compute the shortest paths between all pairs of locations on the IIT Kharagpur campus map.
30 locations have been considered, as shown in the image of the map. Considering each location a node, an integer value starting from 1 is assigned. 
When the user chooses to enter source and destination, Floyd-Warshall algorithm is applied and it generates the minimum distances for every pair of locations. When the user now enters source and destination, along with the minimum distance between the given source and destination, the shortest path to be taken in order to achieve the minimum distance is also displayed.
